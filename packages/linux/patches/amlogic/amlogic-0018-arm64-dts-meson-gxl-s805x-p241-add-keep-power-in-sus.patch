Subject: [PATCH 018/155] arm64: dts: meson-gxl-s805x-p241: add
 keep-power-in-suspend property in SDIO node

The WiFi firmware requires that the power is kept enabled while in
suspend mode. Add the keep-power-in-suspend property in the SDIO node
to specify that the power must be kept when entering in a system wide
suspend state.
